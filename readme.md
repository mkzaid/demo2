#Demo Tutorial 2
This is my second demo project i will upload this to the github from my local pc
lets see how it works

#Adding features
1. Lets see if this is added to my master branch or not 
2. Also i have to improve my typing speed 
3. I am very good typing with my left hand but not so good with my right hand i dont know why
4. i think typing also depends alot on the  brain focus . If you focus so much on what finger will press which word then i blunder a lot 
5. From now on i will write all my lectures on the laptop so that i have a record of when and how long was a lecture takken.
